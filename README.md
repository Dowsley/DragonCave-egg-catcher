# Egg Hunter
## IMPORTANT: This isn't meant to endorse cheating. This script was made just for fun, and because it's possible.
Remember that, according to Dragon Cave's [terms and conditions](https://dragcave.net/terms), *the use of scripts that modify pages on the site in order to give users of said addons an advantage over other users* is objectively against the site's policies.

Before you use this script, remember what is the game purpose, and how it is really intended to be played for achieving true fun. **If you really like the game, think twice before using this script seeking exclusively for self-satisfaction.**

## Instructions
Coming soon, when I make the script at least barely usable and readable, and make it have a account data safety guarantee. 

But for now, you may read through the code if you want.
